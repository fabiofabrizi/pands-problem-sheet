## Weekly tasks from the Programming and Scripting module.
<br>


## Task02 - bmi.py: 
The user is prompted to enter their height in cm and weight in kg and their bmi is calculated.
<br>

        $ python bmi.py
        Enter weight(kg): 65
        Enter height(cm): 180
The BMI is (kg/m<sup>2</sup>): 20.06
<br>

<br>

## Task03 - secondstring.py: 
The user enters a string and every second letter is output in reverse order.
        $ python secondstring.py
<br>

        Please enter a sequence: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

## Task04 - collatz.py: 
The user enters any positive integer and the output is dependent on whether it's even or odd -
If it's even, divide by two,
If it's odd, multiply by three and add 1
collatz.py is the implementation of the collatz conjecture.
<br>

        $ python collatz.py
        Please enter a positive integer: 10
        10 5 16 8 4 2 1
         
<br>

## Task05 - weekday.py: 
When the python script is run, the output message is dependent on whether it's a weekday or the weekend. For example, if the script is run on a Thursday:
<br>

        $ python weekday.py
        Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday
<br>

Whereas when the script is run on a Saturday:
<br>

        $ python weekday.py
        It is the weekend, yay!
<br>

## Task06 - squareroot.py: 
The user is prompted to enter a positive floating-point number and the output is an approximation of its square root.
This uses the Newton method of estimating square roots and not a built-in function.
<br>

        $ python squareroot.py
        Please enter a positive number: 14.5
        The square root of 14.5 is approx 3.8

<br>

## Task07 - es.py: 
The program reads in a text file at the command line and outputs the number of e's contained in the file.
<br>

        $ python es.py moby-dick.txt
        116960
<br>

## Task08 - plottask.py: 
A program that displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes.
